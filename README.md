## Overview and Analysis
    1.  Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
    2.  Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.
    3.  Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
    4.  Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
    5.  Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
    6.  Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
    7.  Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
    8.  Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
    9.  Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
    10. Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.
