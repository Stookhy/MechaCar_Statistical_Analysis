# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview and Analysis
   1.  Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
   2.  Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.
   3.  Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
   4.  Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
   5.  Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
   6.  Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
   7.  Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
   8.  Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
   9.  Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
   10. Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.

## Purpose 

   *  Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
   *  Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
   *  Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
   *  Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

   Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
   
   Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
   
   Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

   What metric or metrics are you going to test?
   
   What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
   
   What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
   
   What data is needed to run the statistical test?
